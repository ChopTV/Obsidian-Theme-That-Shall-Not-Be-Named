# Theme-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named
**Current Version 0.1**

A theme for Obsidian.md inspired by the color palette used by Matheus Zarkov in his theme "Slytherin."

Original Theme that inspired this can be found on github at [Obsidian-Slytherin by Matheus Zarkov](https://github.com/MatheusZarkov/Obsidian-Slytherin)

There are currently three functioning snippets that provide the groundwork for this theme.

1. basecolorscheme.css - Establishes the base default colors for everything explicitly defined in the Default Obsidian Theme.
2. headings.css - Borrows headings formatting from @nickmilo and his Cybertron theme, found here: [Cybertron by Nick Milo](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron)
3. fonts.css - Establishes fonts to be used by headings.css and further snippets. Also borrows from the naming convention established by @nickmilo - currently set to default to Lucida Console, but can easily be changed to anything you want or completely turned off to revert to system defaults.

Current Status:

This is a work in progress.
