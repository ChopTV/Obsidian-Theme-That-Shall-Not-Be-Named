# Theme-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named

A theme for Obsidian.md inspired by the color palette used by Matheus Zarkov in his theme "Slytherin."

Original Theme that inspired this can be found on github at [Obsidian-Slytherin by Matheus Zarkov](https://github.com/MatheusZarkov/Obsidian-Slytherin)

This is a work in progress.
