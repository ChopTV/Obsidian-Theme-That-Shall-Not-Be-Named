# Theme-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named
**Current Version 0.3.0**

A theme for Obsidian.md inspired by the color palette used by Matheus Zarkov in his theme "Slytherin." It pulls from the colors for House Slytherin, Nagini, and some other Harry Potter related things.

Original Theme that inspired this can be found on github at [Obsidian-Slytherin by Matheus Zarkov](https://github.com/MatheusZarkov/Obsidian-Slytherin)

There are currently seven functioning snippets that provide the groundwork for this theme.

1. basecolorscheme.css - Establishes the base default colors for everything explicitly defined in the Default Obsidian Theme.
2. headings.css - Borrows headings formatting from @nickmilo and his Cybertron theme, found here: [Cybertron by Nick Milo](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron)
3. fonts.css - Establishes fonts to be used by headings.css and further snippets. Also borrows from the naming convention established by @nickmilo - currently set to default to Lucida Console, but can easily be changed to anything you want or completely turned off to revert to system defaults.
4. graphview.css - Establishes the base default color over-rides for the graph view that are not defined by default values in the Base Color Scheme.
5. checkboxes.css - Changed the default colors of the check boxes so that they better match the theme as a whole.
6. blockquote.css - Bringing the way blockquotes are displayed in preview mode in line with the theme. Uses only side and bottom borders.
7. tags.css - Converts the tags in preview mode to have more of a button-shape, corners are rounded to match the way blockquotes are presented.

This is a work in progress. If you have any recommendations for improvements, requests for features, or find any bugs, please submit them as an issue. I don't use a whole lot of plug-ins, so I can't promise this will work 100% with all plugins. I will be happy to try and add support for different plugins as I learn which ones need a little TLC.
